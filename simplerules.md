# Simple rules
Simple rules can lead to complex execution and give direction in complexity. Optimal when operating with computational constrains. The human mind has bounded (/finate) cognitive ability. Turn strategy into simple rules.

I compress my views in two operating rules:
* Contribute to the whole
* Love your fate
