# Simple rules
Simple rules can lead to complex execution and give direction in complexity. Optimal when operating with computational constrains. The human mind has bounded (/finate) cognitive ability. [Turn strategy into simple rules](https://hbr.org/2001/01/strategy-as-simple-rules).

I compress my views in two operating rules:
* Contribute to the whole
* [Love your fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) ([Amor Fati](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati))

What comes out is sustainability and grace up to the end of bodily function. A way to maintain contribution. Hence a positive feedback loop.
