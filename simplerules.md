# Simple rules
Simple rules can lead to complex execution and give direction in complexity. Optimal when operating with computational constrains. The human mind has bounded (/finate) cognitive ability. [Turn strategy into simple rules](https://hbr.org/2001/01/strategy-as-simple-rules).

I compress my views in two operating rules:
* Contribute to the whole
* [Love your fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)

What comes out is grace and sustainability up to the end of bodily function. A prerequisite to maintain contribution. Hence a positive feedback loop.
