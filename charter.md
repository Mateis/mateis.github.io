# Entreflane√ªr
A life of leasure and consumption. By the goal of maximising the experience of fun and love. By observing, human life and other nature, and engaging with it, using projects, that can become organisms that can sustain by themselves, in the bedrock of current capitalism, of which many human minds have as part of their structure, in the space of all possible minds. An operating system. Using the wealth and landscape I am in, to make the most of my (short) stay.
