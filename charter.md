# Entreflaneur
My vision of life as Entreflaneur. A life of leasure and consumption. The goal is to maximise the experience of fun and love. For all living. By observasion of human life and other nature. And engaging with it, using projects, that can become organisms that sustain themselves, in the bedrock of current capitalism, which many human minds have as part of their mind structure, in the [space of all possible minds](https://www.edge.org/conversation/murray_shanahan-the-space-of-possible-minds). An operating system. Using the [wealth](https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/) and landscape I am in, to make the most of my (short) stay.

The above is a definition (and not definite). Built from two older words:

[Entre](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entre-), 
[Fl√¢neur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur)

It is the path to [production that contibutes to the whole](/simplerules).
