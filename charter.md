# Entreflaneur
My vision of life as Entreflaneur. A life of leasure and consumption. By the goal of maximising the experience of fun and love. By observing, human life and other nature, and engaging with it, using projects, that can become organisms that can sustain by themselves, in the bedrock of current capitalism, of which many human minds have as part of their structure, in the space of all [possible minds](https://www.edge.org/conversation/murray_shanahan-the-space-of-possible-minds). An operating system. Using the [wealth](https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/) and landscape I am in, to make the most of my (short) stay.

The above is a definition (and not definite). Built from two older words:

[Entre](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entre-), 
[Fl√¢neur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur)

It is the path to [production that contibutes to the whole](/simplerules).
