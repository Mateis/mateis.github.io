#Carving it
An algorithm. A checklist. A flowchart. A Standard. A system. Call it how you want it. Its putting lots of knowledge down in to a repeatable process. It eliminates the need for one (or more) human minds to remember all the important elements to check, the important questions to anwser and evaluate. We can score using the system. It is a way to make assessments, of opportunities, i.e., things you can own (by buying or making).

## Input models
* https://personalmba.com/10-ways-to-evaluate-a-market/
* [Shane Parrish](https://fs.blog/2019/02/investment-algorithm/)
* [Warren Buffet 4 filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du1tYZ4Vj7)
* Inspired (the right product), validation questions (on 2 pages)
* my own notes
* [Master the Money game, and Unshakable, and cited investors in that]
* further investment books
* insert: Taleb, Scale/applicable mental models, and Michael Porter

## The system
Various buckets, for various goals. Goal dependent system. First built a system for one goal. Then for other. Then a system that combines all.
Apply understanding of humans, commerce/business (groups of humans producing things for other humans outsidetheir group) and macro-economic movements and geopolitical monterary policy.

*buckets*
1. Long term (financial) security (e.g. pension, for later when I have lost the ability of productivity, hence, cannot earn or work to support myself and others)
2. Short term liquidity (wealth I would like to be able to access in the short term, for any unforseen concequences or opportunities. Such as ending in a wheelchair, wanting to marry, send my childern to school, or invest in (asymmetric) low risk high return business opportunity)
3. Growth of wealth (exploring bets; rigged bets; bets that are risky for others, without knowledge, and because of knowledge, non-random for me, hence more certain, hence less risk. Risk is simply a messure of how less I know. Risk is relative. Like time. It can be different for one than for another. The difference is my availabilty of models. My availability of knowledge. My ability of predicting the future).

## Implementation
Start with setup for naieve; diversified, broad, flexible. When bets are certain; narrow down (on that specific), focus.

-- list of actual assets owned

You win in capitalism by owning things that others want. Ownership can be of land, objects, and institutions. Owning can be the personal skills you have; the more you have of our (and supporting tools and technologies), the more value can produce in the same amount of time, the more your worth. 

## Execution / experiment running
Ongoing bets / taken positions.
* Onwership / stake in XYZ.
* Ownership / stake in obscured because I want to scale my investment, and not drive prices up in the short term, because of my massive following I have here. but actually, because I have stake, most of the time i would love it if more people invest in what i do, because price move up :) so unless i want more ownership in a company in the short term
