# Carving it
An algorithm. A checklist. A flowchart. A Standard. A system. Call it how you want it. Its putting lots of knowledge down in to a repeatable process. It eliminates the need for one (or more) human minds to remember all the important elements to check, the important questions to anwser and evaluate. We can score using the system. It is a way to make assessments, of opportunities, i.e., things you can own (by buying or making).

## Why
Decisions are often investments and the other way around. Expected returns of what price you pay, and what you get in return. Weighing alternatives, in your resource allocation (resources are time, energy, attention, money and other ownership). It is often about predicting the future returns, sometimes long away from the point of decision making. How far I can look, affects my ability to decide which direction in the branching river I take with my raft. When I cannot see any further, am at the limit of my horizing, decision making is a 50%/50% chance of winning (wiining is getting the result or objective I am after), given the river branches into two directions. Career decisions are investments. Product feature development trade offs are. Relationships are. Buying ownership (of materials, such as a bike) is. A lot of life comes down to deciding where to invest my activities / ownership to attain some goal/aspiration/desire I am after. Thats the funental wisdom it provides.

Applied to specific, it provides a way to invest ownership to get ownership, to grow my ownership. Hence, that capitalistic process, means I remain and gain wealth.

## The system
Various buckets, for various goals. Goal dependent system. First built a system for one goal. Then for other. Then a system that combines all.
Apply understanding of humans, commerce/business (groups of humans producing things for other humans outsidetheir group) and macro-economic movements and geopolitical monterary policy.

*buckets*
1. Long term (financial) security (e.g. pension, for later when I have lost the ability of productivity, hence, cannot earn or work to support myself and others)
2. Short term liquidity (wealth I would like to be able to access in the short term, for any unforseen concequences or opportunities. Such as ending in a wheelchair, wanting to marry, send my childern to school, or invest in (asymmetric) low risk high return business opportunity)
3. Growth of wealth (exploring bets; rigged bets; bets that are risky for others, without knowledge, and because of knowledge, non-random for me, hence more certain, hence less risk. Risk is simply a messure of how less I know. Risk is relative. Like time. It can be different for one than for another. The difference is my availabilty of models. My availability of knowledge. My ability of predicting the future).

## Implementation
Start with setup for naieve; diversified, broad, flexible. When bets are certain; narrow down (on that specific), focus.

-- list of actual assets owned

You win in capitalism by owning things that others want. Ownership can be of land, objects, and institutions. Owning can be the personal skills you have; the more you have of our (and supporting tools and technologies), the more value can produce in the same amount of time, the more your worth. 

## Execution / experiment running
Ongoing bets / taken positions.
* Onwership / stake in XYZ.
* Ownership / stake in obscured because I want to scale my investment, and not drive prices up in the short term, because of my massive following I have here. but actually, because I have stake, most of the time i would love it if more people invest in what i do, because price move up :) so unless i want more ownership in a company in the short term
