Currently Carving - Below is work in progress. I put it out there so you can provide [early feedback](https://forms.gle/3h5CYckTyoCFZczj6).

## Virtues
I Study, compare and intergrate to simply an operation system thats virtious. They are rules of behaviour, you can adopt, that may help you attain things you want. [Things you want](/whatdoyouwant).

Time moves forward. Context changes. Humans not so fast. So the works of others may still apply. Yet be critical, and think for yourself always. To intergrate the latest situational awareness and observations with what works in the past, and built your own best suiting / fit system for the system you are in.
