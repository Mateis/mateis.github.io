# A lightpost in oblivion
I want to know what we do not know. How can we get a hold of it. And position best in it.

*Uncertainty, randomness, unknown, epistomology*

## Why
Curiosity to the max. Whats more stimulating to a curious, then the unknown :)

### applications
**Experiments (take it to the real world, for usefulness and profit)**

## What I found out so far
**Sources of knowledge**

### My take
**Randomness / probabilty is**: we kinda got grips on it. we short of can describe the predicted outcome. but we can only give scope of possible outcomes, and probabilities you will find that outcome. So we kind of understand whats going on, and we can kind of tell what will happen. But we have limited knowledge of the system drivers and expected outcomes.

Then we have different sorts of randomness. Pure randomness, i.e. uniform white noise. Or, a little more predictable, a process or system we have a little more knowledge on, which we can describe using a normal distribution / gaussian distribution, or a power law, or some other distribution of probability, which we fit to some observation or object or system
