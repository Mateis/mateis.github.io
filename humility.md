# Identity
I slowly kill my ego. Let go if it, part by part. Self is dynamic. It is never the same. It is always a snapshot. Take t=0 a snapshot. Take t=1. Deduct t=0 from t=1, and possibly I find something that is *I*. It is the delta. The change over time. I can average. That is I. But I is always defined as the aggregation of I over time. I always includes the time dimension. And the average is different then the aggregated / total I. So I cannot be compressed. I are a specified range in the total scope of time. From my birth to my death. I am a temporary structure. An eddy in the universe. [Attana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta).

I am part of the whole. I am made out of the same building blocks as all else. Let go of ego and self. I will be free. And fulfill my part.
I may cry each time I let go a bit of my ego. As it is like something of me, my idenity, died off. Yet the dying of the ego, born is freedom alive.
