# Identity
I slowly kill my ego. Let go of it, part by part. Self is dynamic. It is never the same. You make take a snapshot. Take t=0 a snapshot. Take t=1. Deduct t=0 from t=1, and possibly I find something that is *I*. It is the delta. The change over time. I can average. That may approximate myself. But I am better defined as the aggregation of me over time. Me is more accurate when it includes the time dimension. And the average is different to the aggregated / total me. So I cannot be compressed. I am a specified range in the total scope of time (which may be infinate). From my birth to my death. I am a temporary structure. An eddy in the universe. [Attana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta).

I am part of the whole. I am made out of the same building blocks as all else. Let go of ego and self. I will be free. And fulfill my part.
I may cry each time I let go a bit of my ego. As it a part of me, a part of my idenity, died off. Yet with the death of ego, born is peace alive.
