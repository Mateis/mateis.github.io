#Identity
Slowly kill your ego. Let go if it, part by part. Self is dynamic. It is never the same. It is always a snapshot. Take t=0 a snapshot. Take t=1. Deduct t=0 from t=1, and possibly you find something that is *you*. It is the delta. The change over time. You can average. That is you. But you is always defined as a total space. You always includes the time dimension. And the average is different then the total you. So you cannot be compressed. You are a specified range in the total scope of time. From your birth to your death. You are a temporary structure. An eddy in the universe.

You are part of the whole. You are made out of the same building blocks as all else. Let go of ego and self. You will be free. And take your part.
You may cry each time you let go a bit of your ego. As it is like something of you, your idenity, died off. Yet the dying of the ego, makes you freedom alive.
