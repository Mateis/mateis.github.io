# What do you want?
I want to know what people want. Join me in my journey / (re)search.

## Why
Because then you can be useful to others. Then you can contribute well. Then you can get rewards in return. To understand myself. To make yourself  happy. It provides meaning. It gives you the right goals. It makes you take right action. It makes you productive. It makes your life useful. Purpose. if you understand what you want, and what others want.

## What I found out so far
People kind of define themselves what they want. They can set their own desires and hurt [1]. People want many different things. Different people have different sets of things they want. And what people wants changes over time. Hence, to pinpoint common desires, is hard. A lot of observations would be needed. That given the large amount of possiblities of desire i.e. dimensions and variables, the variation in intensity of desire, the variation of those variables among humans and the change over time of all of those desires and combinations/sets of them.

**Algorithm**

The steps towards understanding then are:
1. Collect observations. Measurements of which variables are at play. And what are their values.
2. Cluster objects in groups with shared / common

Then, a grid or matrix of categories of people's wants may show up. With some accuracy. 

3. The underlying objects we are tracking, will change over time, hence the clusters will change, and hence the cluster model will be in a permanent state of moving. It will be required to continuesly update.

We can take a shortcut by leveraging the attemps of others of identifing variables and making classicafications of people with sets of desires.
