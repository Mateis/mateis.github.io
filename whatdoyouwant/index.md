# What do you want?
I want to know what people want. Join me in my journey / (re)search.

## Why
Because then you can be useful to others. Then you can contribute well. Then you can get rewards in return. To understand myself. To make yourself  happy. It provides meaning. It gives you the right goals. It makes you take right action. It makes you productive. It makes your life useful. Purpose. if you understand what you want, and what others want.

## What I found out so far
People kind of define themselves what they want. They can set their own desires and hurt [1]. People want many different things. Different people have different sets of things they want. And what people wants changes over time. Hence, to pinpoint common desires, is hard. A lot of observations would be needed. That given the large amount of possiblities of desire i.e. dimensions and variables, the variation in intensity of desire, the variation of those variables among humans and the change over time of all of those desires and combinations/sets of them.

### Algorithm

The steps towards understanding then are:
1. Collect observations. Measurements of which variables are at play. And what are their values.
2. Cluster objects in groups with shared / common

Then, a grid or matrix of categories of people's wants may show up. With some accuracy. 

3. The underlying objects we are tracking, will change over time, hence the clusters will change, and hence the cluster model will be in a permanent state of moving. It will be required to continuesly update.

We can take a shortcut by leveraging the attemps of others of identifing variables and making classicafications of people with sets of desires.

*note: classify list in layers; some are higher order system layers, some lower.*

I also incorporate the central premise of flexibilty of the mind, and the control over one's own desires from
1. Epictetus
2. Spritual

[1] rules; a tony concept

### Groups of people
Profiles.
1. Some people like to think. Others do not wonder.
2. Some people like to explore. Others want to get results with certainty.
3. Some people see benefit of read. Others seek other forms of instant gratification.

It is trade offs. Between alternatives. Limited resources of time, attention and money. People spend on the alternative that they believe/expect gives them results.

What people like, is possible dependent on what they believe / expection is of its usefulness, or potential for the gratification, of deeper level of needs.

Not many people like to invest the time to read and understand. Most seek more direct and instant wins. (no normative judgement what is more effective; just describing observations)
