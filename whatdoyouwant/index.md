Currently Carving - Below is work in progress. I put it out there so you can provide [early feedback](https://forms.gle/3h5CYckTyoCFZczj6).

# What do you want?
A lot of pleasure and pain. But why? I want to know what people want. Join me in my journey / (re)search.

*semantics(tags): want, need, desire, drive, motivation*

## Why
Because then you can be useful to others. Then you can contribute well. Then you can get rewards in return. To understand myself. To make yourself  happy. It provides meaning. It gives you the right goals. It makes you take right action. It makes you productive. It makes your life useful. Purpose. if you understand what you want, and what others want. Humans are the biggest drivers of the world.

In our best intentions we want to help other people. When creating new products and services, new technologies, investing our time, energy and money in to the most useful things for other people. I'd like to help with that. Allocation of resources properly, is very helpful. When we do so, we make sure non of our resources go to waste. Resources are peoples energy, time, money and (physical) materials (of nature aka complex material structures i.e. life and dumb materials e.g. rock)

There are many models. But they are all very different. I make my contribution so we can get closer to the truth. By anwsering: How come they are different? and where do they overlap?

Here is a visual. I worked as followes (research methodology):
1. collect all the important models
2. put them all in one table and document [share table in paper/article/essay]
3. relate where they overlap
4. visualize in network map
5. another cool step

## What I found out so far
People kind of define themselves what they want. They can set their own desires and hurt [1]. People want many different things. Different people have different sets of things they want. And what people wants changes over time. A lot of observations would be needed. That given the large amount of possiblities of desire i.e. dimensions and variables, the variation in intensity of desire, the variation of those variables among humans and the change over time of all of those desires and combinations/sets of them.

### Knowledge algorithm

The steps towards understanding then are:
1. Collect observations. Measurements of which variables are at play. And what are their values.
2. Cluster objects in groups with shared / common

Then, a grid or matrix of categories of people's wants may show up. With some accuracy. 

3. The underlying objects we are tracking, will change over time, hence the clusters will change, and hence the cluster model will be in a permanent state of moving. It will be required to continuesly update.

We can take a shortcut by leveraging the attemps of others of identifing variables and making classicafications of people with sets of desires.

*note: classify list in layers; some are higher order system layers, some lower. then make aggregated master model*

I also incorporate the central premise of flexibilty of the mind, and the control over one's own desires from
1. Epictetus
2. Sprituale

#### Analysis method
Making sense of all the variation. Organise data. Play with it. Simplify, be imperfect. Then be reasonable again.

1. Put all the names in a list
2. Put all the descriptions next to each other
3. Sort alfabetically
4. the models use the worlds and concepts a bit differently in the end.

## My Theory - what do you want
Given the strenght and flexibility of the human mind, I believe there is no central fixed take all *what do you want*. I do believe, there are 'default'  and/or often occuring needs/desires, with various intensities. The intensities are also not fixed, yet some may see patterns in the general in their weights.

*base layer* We are built to survive. *second layer* Our main regulator are experience of pain and pleasure. We want more of pleasure. Less of pain. We can be aware, calculate and reason of our enviornment to get to our goals. Using this, we can overwrite our pain and pleasure system temporary/short term, to get to the latest update on what will be good for our survival.

*third layer*
We survive by fulfulling our (individual) biological needs (we survive our specices, if we all try to survival ourselves, as a default - non cognitive overwrite - state). The biological needs we have, to keep our physical operations going, we need the following input and output are:
**input**
* Oxgyen
* Water
* Food

**output**
* CO2
* Urine
* Defication

**maintain/homeostasis**
* Temperature (stay within bounds of cold and hot that we can operate in)
* Pressure / harm on the structure of our body (stay within bounds that we can operate in)
* Sleep (mental/chemical/physical recovery time - without you die)

I leave out sex, or can you die from not having sex ever? its a strong physical need, nevertheless. yet, weaker then survival (as default?)

*fourth layer*
Very strong / emotional / primal / physical desires that most people have and most people have deeply/intensely.
* Sex
* beloning/relating to other people

Then after the physical / biogical is done. We tend to think about the future. We can anticipate that we will need to take care of our biological functions in the future. Therefore, we have many strategy (variations among people) to assure / risk manage / prepare for the future. This is where the largest varierty / branching starts to happen. We want to relate and position ourselves to the external world, as best as we can, to help our survival, in the near and longer term (beyond the now, after we have fixed the now - again, all in default and general, no single trueth). Think about thinkgs like
* Social status / influence / power over people / significence (because other people are major part of influence in our world. To get things we need like sleep and food, in our enviornment. To survive). Now this is so important for so long, that it has been 'baked in' many of our minds and desires
* Learning/ wisdom, or power over our future, certainty of our future, power over our external envionrment
* Onwership / wealth / materialism (of things that are valueable, and value is socially defined, and social is defined by the desires of people, and those are fundementally biological functioninig sustainblity)
* self-development

*layer five/six*
These are more broader, unifying concepts, that cover a lot of needs, through the layers, that are below it, and benefit from doing / wanting this thing:
* Progress / ambition
* Contributing (social bonding, social status)

*layer six/seven*
In attaining our various (layers) of desires, we have often limited resources (e.g. energy, time, money, attention). Hence, we need to make decisions how to spend those. Hence, we have to make trade-offs between alternatives. We have to, as time moves always forward, and because of the continous operation of the biological bodily function, puts us at these cross roads every time (on a raft in an ongoing river comming at branch points). Hence, which solution is best to attain our goals/our needs/desires/wants. One way we decide on is:

* Efficacy
* Speed
* Reliability
* Ease of Use
* Flexibility
* Status
* Aesthetic Appeal
* Emotion
* Cost 

*education/infuence that an alternative is a good solution for your desire/goal*
Shortcuts that can inform us about something is that we want, actually, these are trust/credability shortcuts. attention on those:
* Reciprocity
* Scarcity
* Authority
* Consistency
* Liking
* Consensus


### Gratification
People have different ways to satisfy. Different internal rules when something is satisfied. For instance, how much of it do you need to be satisfied. Then also different 'solutions' in the external world they can get (e.g. from other humans, from other nature, or objects). The layer four and up, may be our behaviour/wants because we (a majority in the collective) believe/think that attaining these subgoals will get us to gratify deeper layer goals (and down to survival). We can reeducated ourselves with new operating models. Meaning, retrain a human to take other subgoals, that may more optimally reach our survival needs than the current subneeds we have. Hence, 'nature' drives us initially, and then we have a form of ethics, or behavioural / believes / thinking / wanting rules that we think are best. 

I think I implictly follow the reasoning of [Sir William Blackstone](https://www.arsfloreat.nl/documents/Blackstone.pdf) on that nature is the base of our ethics. And human happyness is part of that nature.

We might then, find better operating models, better level four wants and needs to strive for to get to our deeper goals (down/up to survival) more effectively. Enviornments changes, so maybe our standard level four models are not or best suiting/most fit (or accurate) anymore. I may find some anwsers in ethics / operating rules that have been developed, recarved and tested over the last milliena. Which were differen times then now, yet similar in a sense that we would live on small places on earth with many people. That is different then the many thousends of years where we come from, in which we lived in small communities. Hence, [I review 'secrate texts' all over the world for clues](/classictheologyworks.md).

### Why spirts / phisolofies / looking at your internal and external world make you at peace
*Stoics*
Premise (paraphrased): Let go of what you cannot control - or love it, good or bad towards your objectives. And own what you can control, your internal being, and things you are able to control (for sure, which is almost nothing, so maybe do not do this) in the external. 

With this perspective, you don't worry about your social status in the next meeting. loss aversion. Its outside of you. It may be relevant to you, either because you think it does, or really, but its outside of control so let it go.

*Virtues (may) make you effective - christian/antiquity*
If you're prudent, couragous, self-controlled, and just, you are just better for the people around you, or more effective in relating to them, and/or operating in the rest of the external world. Better, means, better in getting your desires.

### Groups of people
People, at a time-situation point/coordinate, want stuff. Figure out what they want:
1. Observe
2. Listen
3. Start by finding the outer layer of want
4. then you can attemt to drill down, all the way down to one of the layer one biological needs, where survival is the baseline

**Profiles.**

1. Some people like to think. Others do not wonder.
2. Some people like to explore. Others want to get results with certainty.
3. Some people see benefit of read. Others seek other forms of instant gratification.

It is trade offs. Between alternatives. Limited resources of time, attention and money. People spend on the alternative that they believe/expect gives them results.

What people like, is possible dependent on what they *believe / expection / system of rules from a to b / structure from [antecedent to concequence](http://www.dementiamanagementstrategy.com/Pages/ABC_of_behaviour_management.aspx)* is of its usefulness, or potential for the gratification, of deeper level of needs.

Not many people like to invest the time to read and understand. Most seek more direct and instant wins. (no normative judgement what is more effective; just describing observations)
