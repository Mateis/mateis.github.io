## Strategy
Start with naitivity. Graduately narrow down to bets with certainty. Uncertainty is just another word for not knowing something. Random is our lack of understanding. Risk is just a measure of how stupid I am. Or are they fundemental properties of the universe? Is the current desciption of quantum mechanics the finish line. Or are there deeper layers, and is here more determinism. I fouch for the latter. History gave us many examples of 'surprises' and statements that 'we know all we ever can know' after which we foud something new, and went through major paradigm shifts. How to be certain you do not know? Asymmetric returns. I do not optimize initially for one scenario. I optimize for all scenarios, plus the [unknown unknown scenarios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightian_uncertainty).
