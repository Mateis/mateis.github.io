# Library of Matthijs
A list of books I have read. This the input I received. You may borrow a book I own. You can reach out to mee if you want to borrow a book. I will not charge you for it. Or you can get a copy for yourself using the purchase link. It does not cost you more when you buy a book via my link. I do get a percentage of the sales price from Bol.com.
