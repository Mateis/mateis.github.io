# Structures
Frames for the world. Many call them mental models. I call them structures. Frames of looking at the world. Coat racks to make sense of it all.

The are fundemental descriptions of observable phenomena, processes and systems from various fields. Multidisciplinairy, interdisciplinary, various aspects and 'levels of systems' in the world: physical in physics, chemistry, biology and the human mind in psychology, economics.

Durable are the core insights in those fields. The core abstract dynamic desciptions of how (that part of) our world works. When knowing these, they can give inspiration for understanding (local and temporaral) situations one is in at one momenent. It can then provide insight for deciding the course of actions at that space-time-problem point.

### My mainframe
A start is to be made to formalize my mind. IÂ´d like to make a visual. A visual map of frames. Like a mindmap, or a landscape card.

**to study them. to learn them. i could make some smart app. cool idea. Lets look at inspiration from other learning apps. like duologo, or other forms of llearn that are effective. I could provide mental model courses. cool. because it suits my interest. and I can be someone that provides 'wisdom to the world'
