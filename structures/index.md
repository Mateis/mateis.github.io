# Structures
Frames for the world. Many call them mental models. I call them structures. Frames of looking at the world. Coat racks to make sense of it all.

## Collections of structures
1. Farnam street, has a book
2. The personal mba guy i think
3. Farnam street recently refered to another book, by the DuckDuckGo founder
4. Model Thinker book
5. Charlie Munger almanac

### My mainframe
A start is to be made to formalize my mind. IÂ´d like to make a visual. A visual map of frames. Like a mindmap, or a landscape card.
