# Vulnerability, expression

Integrity (think=say=do) can get you killed. It is also the fastest way to grow and connect. Expression allows for feedback. The more feedback, the faster the imporevement of accuracy of representations of the world, when received with intellectual humility and good judgement. Expression is the prope, to test the strenght of believes, growing the strenght by integrating the perspectives of others, and relating with others, that share the (updated) believes. Evolution. Adaptation over time, relating to the outside.
